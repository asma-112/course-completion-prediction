# Course Completion Prediction

## Project Description
This project analyzes user interaction data from an online course platform to predict whether a user will complete a course. Python was used for data cleaning, exploration, and applying machine learning models for prediction.

## Files Included
- `online_course_engagement_data (2).csv` : Dataset containing user interactions with courses.
- `Task_1_treining_coop.ipynb` : Notebook with data cleaning, exploration, and machine learning model implementation.

## Project Steps
1. Load and preview the dataset.
2. Import necessary libraries for data analysis and modeling.
3. Data cleaning:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Removing duplicate records.
   - Detecting outliers.
   - Checking if the data is balanced.
4. Machine Learning Models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
   - Model evaluation using cross-validation and accuracy score.

## Objective
Analyze the data and identify factors influencing course completion, and provide a predictive model to improve learner outcomes.
